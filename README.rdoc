== README

This is an example Braintree integration into a Rails app. The actual checkout form is on the "show" page for a Pokemon. 

1. Bundle

2. Migrate

3. Set .env variables like so:

	MERCHANT_ID=sdfhgdskjfgdfg
	
	PUBLIC_KEY=sdfgdsfgdsfgsdfg
	
	PRIVATE_KEY=234234kj234lk5j2h34l5kjk3

4. Profit, but not really because Pokemon is owned by The Pokemon Company and this is just for an illustration. ;)
